- I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhang](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/). I received my B.Eng in [School of Electronic Information and Enginnering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee/main.htm) from [South China University of Science and Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in 2021.
- My research interests lie in Gaussian Splatting, implicit neural representation, image/video compression, image/video coding for machine, low-level vision, and edge AI.

💥 💥 **I am currently seeking internship and full-time job opportunities. If you are interested in my profile, please do not hesitate to contact me.** 💥 💥
